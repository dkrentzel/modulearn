Modulearn provides educators and students the opportunity to participate in the next step in the sustainability evolution occurring in Espoo. Our platform provides schools with the opportunity to integrate sustainable development goals into their core teaching curriculum, all the while making use of the much studied format of project based learning.
 
Modulearn will bring together businesses looking to support sustainability oriented students, and inspire schools to adopt a kaizen approach to their sustainable development. Our aim of developing sustainable habits and knowledge in the leaders of tomorrow, will contribute to Espoo’s goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2030.
 
The platform provides a streamlined experience to help teachers help their students. By using data driven project based learning, students will be able to engage in both the localised impacts of sustainability, all the while gaining valuable insight into the global significance of the SDGs. From years 1-6 the platform will act as a service hub to facilitate the complicated dialogue surrounding the nature of the SDGs. From years 7-9, the platform will act as an integrated pipeline to foster a sense of responsibility and personal involvement in various projects adopted by the schools. By having a mixture of continuous class learning, and long term, actuatable projects, schools will see an increase in both student motivation, and academic performance. 
 
One Stanford study found that classrooms which adopted project based learning saw increases in grades by over 20% in math based subjects, and 15% in social studies. In terms of achieving carbon neutrality, many studies have pointed out that changes in behaviour leads to a higher decrease in CO2 emissions than other traditional efforts. Furthermore the changes tend to be long lasting as behaviour ingrained during formative childhood years tends to be permanent.   
 
Furthermore, the data generated by the project, and aggregated by the platform, will be able to signal which of the SDGs are being best followed, and which still require improvements. Simultaneously, teachers can actively use the platform to track real time behavioural changes and adjust their approaches to fit every individual students’ needs.  Coupled together with the potential for sustainable corporate partnerships, the students will be able to apply their knowledge to real life problem solving situations. 
 
Over the nine years duration of the program, the students will gain key insights into global impacts of the SDGs, the various successes and failures, and crucially, what they as individuals and as a collective can do to help their community. The aim of the platform is ultimately to improve the calls to action that students will undertake, while simultaneously aiding teachers to create and maintain a sustainable focused classroom.
