## What is this?
The **modulearn** platform provides teachers and schools with the tools to **integrate sustainable development goals** into their core teaching curriculum, all the while making use of the much studied format of **project based learning**.

### Dashboard
The dashobard is the **central hub** where the core functionalities of modulearn are showcased. This includes **preparatory material** on upcoming teaching blocks for specific SDGs, **ongoing learning** for the teachers and current **data-driven experiments** being conducted in the classroom with the aim of fostering sustainable behaviours.

### Teaching Blocks
Teaching blocks are **modular course** materials **dedicated to a specific SDG** that aim to seamlessly integrate into the core curriculum. Blocks are essentially **powerful and easily deployable** teaching resources.

### Smart Scheduler
The smart scheduler allows teachers to **book sessions** relating to **SDGs** that are conducted at **partner institutions**, companies or universities. These events are frequently updated and enable teachers to not only talk and discuss the challenges facing us in a classroom setting, but to also **empower students** to work towards a more **sustainable future** by taking action and becoming more knowledgable about the strategies that our partners pursue in contributing their part towards the SDGs.
